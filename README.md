- **React 18** â€” for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** â€” for type safety and more reliable code.
- **Vite** â€” fast development server and build tool with HMR.
- **Axios** â€” for HTTP requests.
- **ESLint + Prettier** â€” for code linting and formatting.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

- `src/components` â€” React components (e.g., `CustomerList`, `CustomerAdd`).
